# PrimCom

PrimCom is a personal _knowledge base manager_, primarily made for
programmers. It is meant to be running in a terminal, thus you can access
and consult it quickly while working.

### Motivation

There are lots of code snippets that I use often but I couldn't reproduce
them easily by heart. When I need such a piece of code, either I look it
up on my blog (if I had written about it), or Google it. When I see the
code, I remember it and I can modify it to my needs. However, looking
up something on the Internet can take time (at least 30-60 seconds).

With PrimCom you can collect _your own code snippets_ with _your own
examples_. You can assign tags to them and find them easily later. PrimCom
can perform two main actions: print the content of a file, or open a
web page.

PrimCom has several useful features. It has tab completion; it can
copy the content of a file to the clipboard; it can syntax highlight
your code snippets; it even has a built-in radio player to keep you
entertained while coding, etc. See the built-in help for a detailed list.

### Quick start

Open a terminal with _dark_ background and launch PrimCom:

    $ ./h.py

If you prefer light background, use the `light()` command or modify
directly the `config.py` file.

Type `h` for help, `d` for the list of available tags.

The project was developed under Ubuntu GNU/Linux with Python 2.7.
